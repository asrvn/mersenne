# Mersenne Prime Finder in Python
A lightweight and decently optimized script for finding Mersenne primes. Uses multi-core processing along with the Sieve of Eratosthenes for generating primes and the PRP/Lucas-Lehmer test to check Mersenne primes. Built-in error handling for the cherry on top.

experimental.py uses PRP to scout Mersenne primes and Lucas-Lehmer to verify them as such
main.py simply uses Lucas-Lehmer for everything
